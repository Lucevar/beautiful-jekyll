Welcome to the website! Check out my mods or the mod lists.

I have three styles of lists.  

**Curated / Guides**:  
The first is a curated style, where I recommend mods that I've tested and know work well together. All the mods I list in these should be compatible with each other, unless I specifically note otherwise.  

**Semi-Curated / Lists**:  
Semi-curated means that I can't personally vouch for every mod included, but I've either played it or heard good things. The criteria for inclusion are much broader than for my curated lists.  


**Uncurated Lists / Catelogues**:  
The point of my catelogues is to list every available mod in that category, to create an overview of what mods are available. I don't make a judgement on quality - if I'm aware that a mod is broken I do my best to point it out in the notes, however.  

[**Dungeons**](https://lucevar.github.io/guides/Dungeons/) - a list of mods that improve Morrowind's existing dungeons or add new dungeons. Quest mods which just happen to include a dungeon (ie where the dungeon isn't the focus of the mod) are usually not included.  

[**MWSE / MGE Mods**](https://lucevar.github.io/lists/mwse/) - a list of mods that rely on the Morrowind Script Extender or the Morrowind Graphics Extender.

[**Festive Mods**](https://lucevar.github.io/lists/festive/) - a list of wintry or holiday themed mods.
