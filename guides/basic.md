# Minimalist Mod List for Beginners
**Updated:** 2018/09/03.  

The idea of this mod list is to provide a basic set of mods for new players or a starter set for more experienced modders building a new installation. AKA it's a checklist for me so I don't have to remember or start from scratch every time I start a new game!  

These are listed in roughly the order you should install them.

This colourfully named mod fixes player animations and rope meshes so that you get stuck much, much less often. It's an absolute lifesaver of a mod.  

# Dialogue Fixes

# Expansion Integration
There are a *lot* of options for these, particular to delay the Dark Brotherhood attacks added by the Tribunal expansion. I personally use these:  
[**Trigger Dark Brotherhood Attack**](http://mw.modhistory.com/download-37-15581) by Cyran0  
This adds a short quest that creates the pretense for making the player a target for assassination. Since the quest is a condition for the Dark Brotherhood attacks it effectively delays the start of the Tribunal main quest until the player decides it is appropriate. The quest is not available until the player has attained at least level six. Additionally, the weaker assassins have been re-equipped with appropriately less-valuable armor.  

[**Solstheim Delayer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45988) by Red Furry Demon  
The quest that gets you to Solstheim is quite annoying if you do not plan to go there, but need Bloodmoon active because some mods require it. This mod makes changes to a few dialogue lines, giving them more specific speaker conditions and slightly altering their quest stage results, so that you won't get any journal entry unless you actually ask about Solstheim.  

Alternatives:
[**Delayed DB Attack v2**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/14891?) by Kir  
[**Illy's Solstheim Rumour Fix**](https://www.moddb.com/games/morrowind/addons/illys-solsteim-rumour-fix) by Illy
