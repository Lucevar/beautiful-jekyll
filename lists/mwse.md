# MGE/MWSE Mods List
**Updated**: 24/08/2018

First grab [**MGE XE**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/41102) and the most recent version of [**MWSE**](https://nullcascade.com/mwse/mwse-dev.zip) and the [**Morrowind Code Patch (MCP)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/19510) for good measure.  

This isn't a list of recommendations - it attempts to catelogue MWSE and MGE mods. Unless otherwise stated I don't vouch for quality or compatibility.  

If a mod requires both MGE and MWSE I usually categorise it under MWSE.  

## MWSE-Lua (2.1+)
[**Expeditious Exit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45634) by NullCascade  
Aka Modder's Delight. Even with the Code Patch Morrowind often crashes on exit, requiring you to kill the process in task manager just to get out of it. It's an irritating waste of time when you're playing, and even worse when you're testing mods and quitting Morrowind 10+ times an hour. This mod squashes that crash, making exiting as quick and easy as it always should have been.  

[**Happy Harvesting**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45627) by NullCascade  
A simple mod that auto-loots plants when you activate them, instead of opening it as a container. Compatible with mod added plants as well. It doesn't affect scripted plants, so it's compatible with mods like Graphic Herbalism, which simply override Happy Harvesting.  

[**Sophisticated Save System**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45608) by NullCascade  
Drastically expands and improves the save system, including autosaves on cell changes. No more playing for hours, crashing, and then realising that your last save was three hours and ten quests back!  

[**Controlled Consumption**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45624) by NullCascade  
Changes the mechanics of how many potions a player can drink. In vanilla, the player is allowed to drink infinite potions with no negative effects, leading to easy alchemy exploits. Offers two options: limit the player to one potion per five seconds, or an Oblivion-style option that allows the player to have only four potions active at once.  

[**Dynamic Difficulty**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45710) by NullCascade  
Configurable difficulty. You can change the base difficulty, make the game harder or easier as you level up, or set the difficulty per region (so you could make the Bitter Coast very easy but the Ashlands much more dangerous, for example).  

[**Easy Escort**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45712) by NullCascade  
Vanilla escort quests are a nightmare because of the terrible pathfinding AI. This mod keeps followers close to you and ensures they don't get stuck on a rock in the ashlands somewhere.  

[**Diligent Defenders**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45717) by NullCascade  
When combat begins, your companions will start to defend you immediately, instead of waiting for you to be attacked first. A real lifesaver if that enemy is going to kill you in one hit and you can't afford to wait!  

[**Proportional Progression**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45697) by NullCascade  
Allows you to easily adjust the progression rate to make leveling skills slower/faster, based on a number of different factors.  

[**Memory Monitor**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45696) by NullCascade  
Provides an in-game alert if you're close to reaching the 4GB memory limit, so that you can save and restart in time to prevent a crash.  

[**Permanently Perished**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45672) by NullCascade  
Adds an optional permadeath mechanic. When you start a new game, you'll be asked how many lives your character gets (defaulting to 1; you can choose not to use permadeath on any given save). Once your lives are used up, you can no longer load that character's saves, and attempting to will start a new game instead.  

[**Sounds of Souls**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45657) by NullCascade  
Adds a chance for soul gems to emit a sound from the creature whose soul they contained. Very atmospheric. *Very* creepy.  

[**Poison Crafting**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45729) by Greatness7  
Adds a new poison mechanic similar to Oblivion and Skyrim's. NPCs can use poison as well! Also allows you to use apparatus in-world rather than having to pick it up and use it from your inventory, and a new alchemy mode where better apparatus decreases positive effects rather than negative so you can craft your own poisons.  

[**Lights Fix for Vtastek's PPL shaders**]() by Greatness7  

[**Glow in the Dahrk**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45886) by Melchior Dahrk & NullCascade  
The most up-to-date and feature rich version of Windows Glow. Includes much more subtle and aesthetically pleasing windows glow, randomly spaced lighting so not every window turns on precisely at dusk and off precisely at dawn, and automatic compatibility with mods using vanilla meshes (such as Tamriel Rebuilt). No more need for infinite patches just to make your windows light up!  

[**Brutal Backstabbing**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45890) by Merlord  
Do more damage when stabbing an enemy from behind (NPCs can also backstab - beware turning your back!).  

[**Automated Ammo Equip**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45845) by Merlord  
Ever want to use both crossbows and regular bows, but get annoyed at having to remember to switch ammo type? This automates it for you.  

[**Frostwind**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45654) by Merlord  
The immersion and survival mod to end all others. Similar to (and inspired by) the Skyrim mod *Frostfall*, it adds weather exposure, hunger, tiredness, and thirst mechanics, while aiming to reward sensible travellers rather than punish bad micromanagement - which makes it, in my experience, much less tedious to play with than any other needs mod.  

[**Magnum Menu Textures**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45859) by Petethegoat  
Improved main menu buttons, with support for MWSE's Mod Configuration Menu.  

[**Pete's Lua GMST config**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45818) by Petethegoat  
Allows you to set GMSTs without having to use an .esp slot - and allows you to hot reload them in game for testing purposes.  

[**Torch Hotkey**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45747) by Remiros  
Adds 'C' as a dedicated hotkey for light sources. Pressing C will equip/unequip the first light source in your inventory, prioritising lights that have already been used. It will also re-equip previously equipped shields, two-handed weapons and ranged weapons. Super convenient!  

[**Lucky Strike**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45765) by R-Zero  
Adds a luck based critical strike mechanic similar to Daggerfall. Works for PCs and NPCs.  

[**Plaguebearer**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45760) by R-Zero  
Enables the transfer of diseases from PCs to NPCs. Now you can be the Nurgling you always wanted to be!  

[**Putting Power in Willpower**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45742) by R-Zero  
Willpower is described as affecting your abilities to resist spells, but in vanilla it is bugged and doesn't work. This mod enables it, for PCs and NPCs.  

[**Time Flies!**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45727) by cptjoker  
In vanilla Morrowind, time is frozen while you're in a menu, such as the dialogue window or while reading a book. This mod makes time pass while you're in those menus. Now if you spend all night talking to Hassour Zainsubani about Ashlander customs, it really does take all night!  

[**Vaba-Amus Companion Character**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45711) by TheDrunkenMudcrab  
Adds a drunken scrib to Suran, just outside Desele's. If you choose to talk to him, you'll be in for some wacky and hilarious adventures - that fit in to lore surprisingly well.  

[**MWSE Alchemy Filter**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44808) by Greatness7  
You can now filter ingredients based on their effects.  

[**MWSE 2.1 Enchantment Services**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45554) by svengineer99  
Adds new services to enchanters, including the ability to recharge enchanted items and making additional copies of scrolls.  

[**MWSE2.1 Sky Diversity Auto Launch Add On**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45600) by svengineer99  
Autolaunches Sky Diversity so you don't have to remember to do it manually every time you want to play.  

[**The Forgotten**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45733) by Team Horny Skulls  
A quest mod dealing with a cult of Namira, with options to side with the cultists or the ordinators.  

[**Invisibility Anti-Exploit**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45899) by Remiros, Greatness7, and NullCascade  
In the vanilla game invisibility has a relatively major bug/exploit. While you are invisible and not directly in the line of sight of an NPC, the sneak chance will always be 100%, even if your sneak, agility and luck are as low as 0, which pretty much allows you to steal absolutely everything. This has to do with the fact that the AI doesn't update quickly enough after exiting invisibility. This mod fixes this by preemptively removing the invisibility effect and delaying the activate function by a single frame.  

[**Dimensional Containers**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45883) by ProfArmitage  
Adds four magical portable containers hidden across Vvardenfell that can hold far more than their size suggests and never increase in weight. They're quite heavy but allow you to carry more overall - if you can find them and get through the dungeons. Rumours in towns will give you vague hints.  

[**Configurable Barter Gold**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45942) by DarkholmeTenk  
This mod adds a new setting to the Mod Configuration menu added by the latest version of MWSE which allows you to set a multiplier to every merchant's gold amounts. If you think NPCs generally have too much or too little gold you can adjust it now.  

[**Ownership Indicator**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45940) by Petethegoat  
Ownership Indicators adds an Oblivion style ownership indicator, when you look at owned items, beds, and more. Compatible with all crosshair texture replacements. Uses Lua instead of old MWSE/MGE functions as previous ownership indicators have.  

[**Immersive Run Fix**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45947/) by Petethegoat  
This mod normalizes the player's movement speed, ensuring they run at a consistent speed even during diagonal movement.

[**Continue**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45952/) by Petethegoat  
Adds a continue button to the main menu, to instantly load your most recent save. This can also optionally hide the credits button to stop the main menu from becoming too cluttered. This also includes a secret testing feature to load into a specified save game even faster- uncomment two of the lines at the top of main.lua, and choose a filename and key code. Instantly load into a save by holding your key while the game starts up. Several menu texture replacers have compatibility options for this.  

[**Tamrielic Lore Tooltips**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45954/?tab=description) by PhDInSorcery  
Tamrielic Lore is an in-game book describing the stories behind each artifact the player encounters in Vvardenfell. This mod adds the book's lore to the tooltips of each respective artifact. Note that this mod does not actually change the items themselves; it uses MWSE-Lua to add onto their tooltips. It is therefore compatible with everything!  

[**Value/Weight Ratios on Tooltips**](http://abitoftaste.altervista.org/morrowind/index.php?option=downloads&task=info&id=97&Itemid=50&-Value-Weight-Ratio-Tooltip) by abot  
Displays the Value to Weight ratio on item tooltips so you can see at a glance if an item is worth taking or not.  

[**Tooltip**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45969) by abot  
An updated version of previous Value/Weight Ratio mod (renamed from ValueWeightRatio to Tooltip as functionality may increase. By default displays Value/Weight Ratio, you can change setting below in main.lua file to true or false to enable extra functionality. You can also enable showing whether or not a skill book has already been read.  

[**Ingredient Flavour Texts**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45956/) by Remiros  
This mod adds flavor texts to all ingredients in the game, expansions included. Like Tamrielic Lore Tooltips this should be compatible with everything since it doesn't edit the objects themselves.  

[**Get Lost!**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45981?) by NullCascade  
Removes the minimap and the world map, for maximum immersion. Better find a compass and a paper map!  

[**Equipment Requirements**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45980) by Remiros and Greatness7  
This mod adds skill requirements for all armors and weapons in the vanilla game, its expansions and all mods mentioned in the last section. The requirements are directly based on the skill of the respective item.  

[**Dahrk's Super-Sized Storage (D'sSSS)**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45147) by Melchior Dahrk  
This simple mod increases the capacity of all containers (BM and TR included) by x100. Zero capacity containers are unaltered (0*100=0). For instance, crates in the original game had a weight capacity of 200. By applying this mod, they will be able to hold 20,000. Enough to help you sort out those pesky dwemer cogs.  

[**UI Inspector**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45964/) by Hrnchamd  
UI viewer and interactive editor for Morrowind UIs. Allows inspection of the UI menu hierarchy and all layout values. Layout variables can be modified in-game for fine-tuning your own UIs.  

[**Consistent Main Menu**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45982) by twizz0r  
New high-quality replacer textures that homogenize main menus so that MWSE's MCM and Petethegoat's Continue Mod menu items don't look out of place. Especially useful for those using alternate UI's and/or alternate main menu images. OG version also included for those that roll old school.

## Old MGE/MWSE (<= 2.0) (should still work with MWSE2.1+, but these mods don't use Lua.)
[**MWSE 2.1 Pursuit Revisited**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45904/) by svengineer99

5) Crime, Flee and related AI tweaks  
[**Death and Resurrection**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45959) by Xiran  
Death will take Attribute points away from you if (when) killed, so it's better not die too much. You'll be resurrected at the nearest Temple, temporarily much weaker,  must return to where you got killed and pay attention not to die again (or penalty will be higher than in consecutive "normal" deaths) . You can also change your birthsign.  
[**Cast on Strike Bows**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/45913) by efrost  
Cast-on-strike enchantments on bows and crossbows work. Arrows and bolts are enchanted on the fly, and they're replaced with their unenchanted versions when you swap them out--even with hotkeys. Enchanted ammo works normally. Make sure MCP's "Fix enchant options on ranged" is **disabled**.  
[**MCC Leveller**](https://www.nexusmods.com/morrowind/mods/44294) by mg79 - Skills based smooth levelling similar to GCD, where multiple skills contribute to attribute level ups. State-based health. Skills decay if you don't use them for long periods of time.
