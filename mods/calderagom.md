Caldera's Mages Guild always seemed a little bit... forgotten about. It had no quests, nowhere to sleep, nothing to do. In short, it was boring.  

This mod fixes at least some of those issues by adding new areas + quests.

It adds:  
A library with books you can borrow depending on your rank in the Mages Guild. Use MCP's Ownership Indicator option to check if you can take them or not!  
Private quarters with bedrooms for guild members, and a dorm that the player can stay in for free (look for the single beds with no stuff on them in the bottom room)  
A room for the player to rent - check the leaflets around the guild, or speak directly to Medila Indaren.  
A kitchen. The caretaker, Asarra, will give members of the Mages Guild some food if you ask about a "good meal" (you can get the topic by asking her about little secrets first). No more dying of hunger while standing in a fully stocked kitchen if you use a mod like NoM or Bare Necessities!  
4 new npcs (3 in the guild hall, 1 quest related) - with some custom dialogue.  
1 new social-based quest suitable for low level characters. Speak to Medila Indaren to start it.  
Some new books by Stuporstar (from "Books of Vvardenfell") (4 total) and from Daggerfall (4 total)  
In general a more interesting experience to explore - and more rewarding for thieves, as long as you don't get caught.
No overpowered loot.  

I recommend playing this mod with Von Django's Magical Missions, which adds quests to Folms Mirel, and Melchior Dahrk's Mage Robesï»¿, which adds some awesome new robes to members of the Mages Guild (+ a quest and some nifty other features). Mage Robes even comes with a patch that adds the new robes to my npcs! The two mods are compatible even without the patch, though.  

=================  
Installation:  
=================  
1. Extract this archive to any folder and then copy the contents to Morrowind's Data Files folder.  
2. Start Morrowind Launcher, click Data Files, and enable Caldera Mages Guild Expanded.esp  

=================  
Un-Installation:  
=================  
1. Save your game in a cell, preferably an interior, that isn't affected by this mod, and close Morrowind.  
2. Start Morrowind Launcher, click Data Files, and disable the Caldera Mages Guild Expanded.esp file.  
3. Delete the .esp file from your Morrowind/Data Files folder.  

=================  
Compatibility:  
=================  
This is INCOMPATIBLE with Stavroguin/Heinrich/Gevalt's Mages Guild Aesthetics Overhaul. It is probably incompatible with other mods that expand the guildhall.  

This should be compatible with any mods which don't make major changes to the interior of the guild. For example, Melchior Dahrk's Mage Robes or Children of Morrowind.
