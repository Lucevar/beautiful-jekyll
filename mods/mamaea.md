Part of Morrowind Modding Madness 2018  

In vanilla Morrowind, Mamaea is a dull maze of caves with nothing remarkable about them aside from the spine of bone down the center of the cavern network. This mod aims to make Mamaea a more memorable visit for the player while also delving into the lore behind the settlement of Gnisis and the West Gash. The lighting has been reduced for a more atmospheric experience alongside much, much more detail. The area has also been expanded with the addition of a buried dunmer stronghold full of new puzzles for the player to solve. You can expect to find new loot, lore, and more when you explore Mamaea Awakened.
